Dahlia studio is an editor for the <a href="https://solar2d.com/">Solar2D</a> game engine. In addition to letting you design and create your game's levels, UI and resources without writing code, it also provides access to multiple unique features that are not present in solar2d.

Traditionally, making games with solar2d meant using different third-party tools to create every graphical effect and asset that your game needs, unlike other engines, which allow you to create most of these in the engine's own editor.

Dahlia studio changes this by drastically reducing the number of third-party tools you'll need to interact with when making your game.

Dahlia studio includes a particle editor, sprite animation editor, scene editor, object property inspector, and more. We're constantly working to add more features to dahlia as well as improve existing ones.

An added advantage of using dahlia is that anything you create is sure to look and feel exactly as you intended, as the editor itself is made with solar2d.
