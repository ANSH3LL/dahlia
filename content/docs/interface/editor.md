Dahlia studio makes use of <a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/composer" target="_blank">composer</a> to manage the scenes in your project. However, you can switch to a scene manager of your choice by editing your project's `scene scripts` if composer doesn't meet your project's needs.
